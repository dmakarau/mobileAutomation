# Into
The test task was implemented using the following technologies:
- Appium
- Serenity BDD as a wrapper for tests
- Cucumber as BDD framework
- TestNG as testing framework
- Maven as bulding system
- Java as programming language
The tests are written in BDD style. In folder `src/test/resources/features` there is a feature file with the two test scenarios.

# Preconditions
- JVM 1.8 or later
- Apache Maven 3.6.3
- Inside the app, add the apk file of the application
- Inside the TestData.java the valid credentials for login should be added (to prevent to pushing password to the github)

 P.S. I know it is also not gut to store the credentials in the java file, but depending on the realisation and integration with CI, we might want to use Github actions 
 secrets to store the confidential data.
 Also I test this project only on Android app, but it should also work with ios (see serenity.properties file), but the locators for the ios app should be added in the page
 objects.

# Run the tests
- to run all 2 task: `mvn clean verify`- Maven will install all the necessary dependencies and run the tests
- `mvn serenity :aggregate`to generate the test report (index.html file)
- directly from the IDE, from Runner.java file

After test execution - the test report with the screenshot is located in the 
`target/site/serenity/index.html`
